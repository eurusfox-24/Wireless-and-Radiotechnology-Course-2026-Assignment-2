# RF Communication – Lecture 2 MATLAB Assignment Report

### Assignment A1: Time and Frequency Domain Analysis
In this assignment, a multi-tone signal $V_{in}(t)$ was synthesized using four distinct sinusoidal components at 500, 600, 700, and 800 Hz. The time-domain plot, focused on the first 10 ms, displayed a complex, periodic waveform resulting from the summation of these various frequencies. By applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the frequency-domain magnitude plot clearly identified four distinct peaks at the exact specified frequencies. This analysis demonstrated that while the time domain shows how a signal changes over time, the frequency domain is essential for identifying the individual spectral components that make up the signal.

### Assignment A2: Signal Filtering and Isolation
The objective of A2 was to isolate specific frequency components from the multi-tone signal using different filter topologies. By applying a Low-Pass Filter (LPF) with a 550 Hz cutoff, the 500 Hz tone was successfully isolated. Conversely, a High-Pass Filter (HPF) was used to extract the 800 Hz component and, in a separate configuration, both the 700 and 800 Hz components. A Band-Pass Filter (BPF) was utilized to isolate the 600 Hz tone by suppressing frequencies both above and below the target. The resulting spectra after filtering showed a significant suppression of unwanted tones, proving that filtering is a critical process for channel selection and interference rejection in RF receivers.

### Assignment A3: Frequency Translation and Modulation
In the final assignment, a 100 Hz baseband message signal was modulated onto a 2000 Hz carrier signal through mathematical multiplication (AM-style). The time-domain plot of the modulated signal illustrated the "envelope" effect, where the low-frequency message shapes the amplitude of the high-frequency carrier. The FFT analysis confirmed the occurrence of frequency translation: the energy originally centered at 100 Hz was shifted to the passband, appearing as new sideband components at 1900 Hz ($f_c - f_m$) and 2100 Hz ($f_c + f_m$). This process is fundamental in RF systems for shifting signals to higher frequencies that are efficient for wireless transmission and antenna design.
